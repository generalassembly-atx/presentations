# WDI Presentations

Outline for project presentations in WDI Austin.

## Create a README

Create a README using Markdown. [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a lightweight and easy way to format documentation for your projects on GitHub.  

1. Create a file called **README.md** in the root of your project repository
2. Include sections for: 
 - Project Description
 - Technologies Used
 - User Stories
 - Wireframes

> **User Story Format:** As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit).

## Presentations

**Every person in your group must talk!**

Presentation Structure:

1. **Problem**: Explain what your app does, the problem it is trying to solve, how you are fixing that problem, and why you wanted to create it in the first place.
2. **Demo** your project! Have a clear plan of the order in which you're going to show the main features of your application.
3. **Process**: Tell us about your process. Show us your **README** file and walk us through: 
 - User stories
 - Wireframes
 - Technology used and Why
4. **Code**: Show your code! Pick out 1-2 of the most interesting/challenging bits of code and walk us through them.
5. **Reflection/Next Steps**: Rose, bud, thorn
 - Rose: What are you most proud of? 
 - Bud: What are you planning on working on next? What do you want to continue to improve?
 - Thorn: What were some pain points and something you might do differently next time?

## Tips

- We'll tell the critiquers how long you had to work on these projects. Justifications like "I would have done X, but we only had 4 days" don't belong in the presentation – be confident about what you have built. You'll have plenty of time to let us know about X in the next steps section.
- On that note, be positive in general! Nothing is more uncomfortable than a negative presentation.
- Plan your demo beforehand. That includes everything you're planning to type in and everything you're going to click. Be careful of audience participation for the inputs – that increases the chance of errors!
- Be professional, but have fun!
